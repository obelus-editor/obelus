/// window draws the light itself, on its own clock and out of the two
/// colours the view said -- so the ramp is the one thing on that screen it
/// does not read, and a ticker for it is twelve pages a second pushed at a
/// front end that throws them away. On the one screen a reader leaves up
/// while they decide what to open.

/// Deliberate break: drop the `!obelus_config::in_a_window()`. The
/// application then asks to be woken twelve times a second for a colour
/// nobody reads.
