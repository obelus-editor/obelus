# obelus

A terminal code **reader**. In the AI era every line you read is a line you did
not write, so browsing is the product and editing is incidental. The eventual
point is to join the LSP semantic graph to the git timeline — jump to a
definition from inside a diff, symbol-level history — which no terminal tool
does today.

Say *code reader*, never *editor*. Called an editor, it gets measured by an
editor's checklist (multiple cursors? macros? completion?), none of which it
wants.

## Commands

```
cargo build
cargo test
cargo +nightly fmt              # NOT `cargo fmt`
cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets
cargo run -- src/app.rs
UPDATE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test    # regenerate golden cell grids
cargo test -- --ignored         # the slow real-server test
```

`.rustfmt.toml` uses five nightly-only options. Stable `cargo fmt` silently
ignores them, and mixing the two makes the formatting oscillate. **Always
`cargo +nightly fmt`.** The build itself is stable.

Clippy must be silent. `src/lib.rs` denies missing documentation, so every
public item needs a doc comment.

## Rules that are easy to break by accident

**Every test must be checked by breaking the thing it covers.** Write the test,
then deliberately break that path and watch the test fail. Seven tests here
passed while the feature under them was broken; each was found this way and no
other way. If a break does not fail the test, the test is not testing what its
name says — fix the test, and say in a comment what the deliberate break was.
Beware of "breaks" that are equivalent rewrites, and of assertions that ask the
rule under test what it expects.

**All coordinate arithmetic lives in `text.rs`.** Five newtypes with private
fields (`ByteOffset`, `CharOffset`, `LineNumber`, `CharColumn`,
`DisplayColumn`, plus `Utf16Column`) exist so that byte, character, display
column and LSP column cannot be mixed up. Nowhere else adds or subtracts them.

**Commands are actions; navigation is not a command.** Arrow keys, paging, a
picker's selection keys belong to whichever component owns the state they move.
`:cursor.up` is meaningless to invoke by name. The key table is *data* on
`App`, so anything that displays a key reads that table and a rebind changes
every display of it.

**Modifiers are judged exactly, in one place.** `keymap::modifiers_of` is the
only judge; `SUPER`/`HYPER`/`META` disqualify a key rather than being masked
away. Masking meant `ctrl+super+q` quit.

**`dispatch` has no wildcard arm** and warns on one, so a new `Command` fails
to compile until it is handled. Same idea in `theme`: only fields with readers.

**Nothing writes to stdout.** stdout is the drawing surface; `tracing` goes to
a file. A stray `println!` lands in the middle of a frame and stays there.

**No async runtime.** One `std::sync::mpsc` channel, one producer thread per
event source (keyboard, file walk, watcher, each server's stdout), the main
loop blocking on `recv()` and draining with `try_recv()`. Writing to a server's
stdin needs its own thread, because a busy server stops draining the pipe. An
answer that arrives after the world has moved on is the normal case, which is
why requests record the version they asked against.

**No configuration file exists.** Rebindable keys are guaranteed by the key
table being data, not by reading a file. Two features now want a config file
(Nerd Font icons, user theme colours); adding one is a decision, not a chore.

## Shape

```
src/
  app.rs          state, the loop's handler, and every picker's item source
  text.rs         the Rope wrapper: the only place coordinates convert
  buffer.rs       one open file: text, syntax, cursor, viewport
  keymap.rs       chords, contexts, the default table, modifiers_of
  icons.rs        the Nerd Font switch and every glyph behind it
  command/        the Command enum, its table, groups, and dispatch
  picker/         one component, five instantiations, nucleo matching
  syntax/         language registry (14 languages), parsing, highlights, tags
  lsp/            transport, client, actions, positions, outline
  ui/             editor, status bar, picker, welcome, shared cell writers
tests/            integration tests plus tests/fixtures/*.txt golden grids
```

Two rules the views share and neither enforces: **leave a blank column after
a Nerd Font glyph** (the non-`Mono` variants draw two cells wide while the
terminal allocates one), and **whether the font has a glyph cannot be
detected** — a terminal's column advance comes from Unicode width tables, not
from the font, so there is one switch (`icons::NERD_FONT`) and a fallback
behind every glyph.

Golden fixtures dump every cell's symbol, foreground and background, plus the
cursor position. Colours are in them because highlighting, themes and the
status bar's background are otherwise not asserted at all: a list of file names
can render perfectly and show nothing.

**Run them in the real checkout, not in a `git worktree`.** The welcome screen
prints the working directory (`welcome_64x20`, `welcome_narrow_34x10` both
carry `~/Work/obelus`), so every fixture that shows it fails in a worktree for
a reason that has nothing to do with the change under test — and
`UPDATE_FIXTURES=1` there writes the worktree's path into the fixture, which
then fails everywhere else. `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` in a worktree are
fine; `cargo test` belongs in the checkout.

The git tests build real repositories in a temp directory, with one
deliberate exception: `the_committed_text_comes_from_git` reads *this*
repository's `src/lib.rs` through `git show`, because a diff of what git
actually has against what is on disk is the only thing that says the two
halves agree. It asserts nothing about whether that file is currently dirty.

## Comments

Comments say *why*, and are worth writing where the code is right for a reason
that is not visible — an ordering that matters, a rule that fails silently, a
plausible alternative that is wrong. Don't narrate what the line does. The
existing code is the style guide; match its density.

## Not now

Workspace symbols and hover (the file outline is done), M1c (diagnostics, a
gutter that holds more than line numbers), searching a file (`ctrl+f` is left
unbound for it), the rest of M2's git (history, blame, tree diffs, staging --
the working tree's own diff is done: `src/git/`, the margin, the map beside
the scrollbar, `git.hunk` and the steps between hunks), the diff/semantic
bridge (M3), symbol-level history (M4), the agent bridge (M5), and a minimal
editing set, last. Don't start on these without being asked.

`git show` and `git status` are shelled out, behind `git::head_text` and
`git::statuses`. A library (`gix`) is worth its weight when the views arrive
and can take over behind those two without anything above noticing; four
hundred crates for one blob read is not.

Also waiting on a configuration file, which does not exist: the Nerd Font
switch, user theme colours, the server table, and the word-wrap toggle all
want one.
